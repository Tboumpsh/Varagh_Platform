I have been working seriously for a few months.
And I believe that science must be experienced, coding should be so coded until it is learned.
Hope you follow most of my work in the future.


## How to use it?
Oh comrade! It was a good question.
This project cannot be kept in the Github Run (but with trouble) because of its small server and database, so download it first and then open the terminal and by `npm i` until all the files And install the packages on your location, then drive the project by writing the `npm run dev` command.
Hope to work with it for you to enjoy
